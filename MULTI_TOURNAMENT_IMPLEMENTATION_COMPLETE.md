## **🚀 Final Setup Steps**

### **Step 1: Apply Database Migration**

You need to run the database migration to add tournament support. Choose one of these methods:

#### **Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250101000000_multi_tournament_support.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the migration

#### **Option B: Using Supabase CLI**
```bash
# If you have Supabase CLI installed
npx supabase db push
```

#### **Option C: Manual SQL Execution**
Run the SQL commands from `multi-tournament-migration.sql` directly in your database.

### **Step 2: Verify Implementation**

Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
node test-multi-tournament.js
```

### **Step 3: Start Development Server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

### **Step 4: Test the Features**

1. **Check Navigation**: Look for the tournament selector in the navigation bar
2. **Switch Tournaments**: Use the dropdown to switch between tournaments
3. **Verify Data**: Confirm that data changes when switching tournaments
4. **Test Mobile**: Check that the mobile menu includes tournament selection

## **🎯 How It Works**

### **Tournament Selection**
- **Dropdown in navigation** shows all available tournaments
- **Current tournament** is highlighted and shows status
- **Click to switch** - data loads instantly
- **Persistent selection** - remembers your choice

### **Data Isolation**
- **Teams**: Only show teams from selected tournament
- **Matches**: Only show matches from selected tournament
- **Leaderboard**: Only calculate for selected tournament
- **Scores**: Only show scores from selected tournament

### **Tournament Management**
- **Active tournaments** are highlighted in green
- **Completed tournaments** show historical data
- **Upcoming tournaments** are marked as scheduled
- **Archived tournaments** are hidden from public view

---

## **📊 Example Usage**

### **Current State**
```
🟢 Patrons Cup 2025 (Active) - Your current tournament
⏳ Spring Championship 2025 (Upcoming) - New tournament
✅ Patrons Cup 2024 (Completed) - Historical data
📦 Winter Classic 2024 (Archived) - Archived tournament
```

### **Creating New Tournaments**

You can create new tournaments by inserting into the `tournaments` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO tournaments (name, slug, description, start_date, end_date, status, format) 
VALUES (
  'Summer Cup 2025', 
  'summer-cup-2025', 
  'Summer season tournament', 
  '2025-06-15', 
  '2025-06-17', 
  'upcoming',
  'patrons_cup'
);
```

## **🔧 Customization Options**

### **Tournament Formats**
- **Patrons Cup**: Current format (4BBB, Foursomes, Singles)
- **Custom**: Define your own match types and rules
- **Stroke Play**: Individual stroke play format

### **Point Systems**
- **Default TOCs**: Standard Tournament Terms of Competition
- **Custom Points**: Define your own point values
- **Division-specific**: Different points for different divisions

### **Settings**
- **Course**: Set different courses for different tournaments
- **Player Limits**: Customize team sizes
- **Match Types**: Enable/disable 3-way matches, pro matches, etc.

## **🎯 Next Steps**

1. **Apply the database migration** (Step 1 above)
2. **Test the implementation** (Step 2 above)
3. **Start using the system** (Step 3 above)
4. **Create additional tournaments** as needed
5. **Customize settings** for different tournament types

---

## **🆘 Troubleshooting**

### **If Migration Fails**
- Check that you have the correct database permissions
- Verify that the `tournaments` table doesn't already exist
- Run the migration in smaller chunks if needed

### **If Tournament Selector Doesn't Appear**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify that tournaments are loaded in the context
- Ensure the navigation component is updated

### **If Data Doesn't Filter**
- Check that `tournament_id` is set on existing data
- Verify that the context is filtering by current tournament
- Check browser console for loading errors
